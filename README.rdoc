= Google Places

This gem provides a Ruby wrapper around the Google Places API, using HTTParty. At this moment the gem does
not support OAuth authentication and will only work with an API key.


== Obtaining an API key

To be able to use this gem, you'll need a Google Places API key. To request an API key, point your browser to
https://code.google.com/apis/console and follow the instructions there. You'll find your API key on the
*API Access* tab under *Simple API Access*.


== Installing the gem

To use this gem, install it with <tt>gem install google_places</tt> or add it to your Gemfile:

  gem 'google_places'

And install it with <tt>bundle install</tt>


== Usage

=== The spot

Each of the API methods below returns a <tt>GooglePlaces::Spot</tt> or a collection of those. Each of these
objects has these attributes:

* *reference*: a token to query the Google Places API for more details about the spot
* *vicinity*: the street or neighborhood of the spot
* *lat*: the latitude of the spot
* *lng*: the longitude of the spot
* *name*: the name of the spot
* *icon*: a URL to the icon of this spot

=== Retrieving a list of spots

First register a new Client:

  @client = GooglePlaces::Client.new(API_KEY)

Then retrieve a list of spots:

  @client.spots(-33.8670522, 151.1957362)

=== Retrieving a single spot

First register a new Client:

  @client = GooglePlaces::Client.new(API_KEY)

Then retrieve the spot:

  @client.spot('CmRYAAA...upoTH3g')
